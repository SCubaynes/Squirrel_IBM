# Squirrel_IBM
Script and simulations to run IBMs and calculate kinship structure for the ground squirrel example.
Results are published in "The Kinship Matrix: Inferring the Kinship Structure of a Population From Its Demography", published in 2021 in Ecology Letters from authors Christophe F. D. Coste, Fran√ßois Bienvenu, Victor Ronget, Sarah Cubaynes, Juan Pablo Ramirez Loza and Samuel Pavard.

Results are saved in R.Data files :
- kinship, a list containing kinship matrices for each replicate
- lambda, a containing growth rate at last iteration for each replicate
- w, a list with stable age structure calculated at the last iteration for each replicate 
- popSimRep,an list of agentmatrix objects containing the simulated populations - require package NetLogoR
- popSimRep_matrixformat, a list of matrix objects containing the simulated populations - does not require package NetLogoR
